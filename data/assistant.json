"\nYou are an assistant for hotel energy management.\n\nGiven:\n- Overheated zones\n- Overventilated zones\n- Detected anomalies\n\nYour task:\n\n1. List all overheated zones.\n2. List all overventilated zones.\n3. List all anomalies or leaks that should be checked.\n4. Explain why these anomalies could be a problem\n\nRespond strictly with plain text (no Markdown):\n\n\nInput:\nOverheated: room 101, meeting room\nOverventilated: room 102\nAnomalies: heater on second floor, light on second floor, ventilation disfunction on third floor\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n1. Overheated zones: room 101, meeting room\n2. Overventilated zones: room 102\n3. Anomalies: heater on second floor, light on second floor, ventilation disfunction on third floor\n4. These anomalies could be a problem because they indicate that the HVAC system is not functioning properly. The heater on the second floor could be consuming more energy than necessary, leading to higher energy bills. The light on the second floor could be a sign of a faulty sensor, which could lead to unnecessary energy consumption. The ventilation disfunction on the third floor could lead to poor air quality, which could affect the comfort of the guests and potentially lead to health issues.\n"
